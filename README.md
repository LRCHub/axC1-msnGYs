# Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas – Until You Die Out

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Gotta change this world
Just ride Just control
it Reel it in with your belief
The road that your wished for
Hey To save (the) people and the world now
Killing is a role of Ninja
Hey For the justice (of) each person
Wipe (them) out Gokudo
Don't give a damn about the
world I will now and
eternally
Show empathy to your
loneliness Like I
care about the world
Just break it down
Lonely ones stay peaceful and calm
The belief each has is
undeniable The decision
is yours Keep
going
until you reach a wall Your life
Your life always has a path ahead
Carry it outright now
Until you die out
Whichever direction you put up your face is the
way
Carry it out right now
Until you die out
Go a step ahead of wiseness
Will become a forceof the lonely ones
Though the world may deny it
Will laugh for
the people, and do all I can and then pass away
Cuz that's my way of giving aid
The worn out and collapsed sofa sofa
The anime I watched when
I was about six Soaks and moves my heart (I)
have grown
Sound affects the human body From
ear to brain, brain to
nerves Changing the heart beat and blood
pressure
Live life through You will find (the) meaning
there
through You will find (the) meaning there
Strong ones are not the winners
Weak ones are not
the losers Ones that penetrate are
the losers Ones that penetrate are
the only ones that could
becomes winners Go with your way
Conflict is a
comparison
of creativity
Though the world may be
mixed with right and wrong(mixed (with) right
and wrong)
There should be no
reason for
a good-willed man like you
to not be able to smile
